<!-- ## A longer note

Hello, I'm Owen, and I myself have benefited in the past from the free tools developed by countless volunteers and have gained so much lifelong knowledge that it reinforces my belief that **EQUAL** access to information is the most important right we all have.So I've created a lot of free bilingual tools to help people access more effectively (while looking forward to the day when we can move away from these aids)

To date, Immersive Translate has helped more than **400,000** people develop the habit of reading information in a foreign language.

Before Immersive Translate:

- Ordinary translation tools display the translation directly, and you need to switch back and forth between the original and the translation when you encounter something that doesn't make sense.
- Ordinary translation tools only support their own translation engines, which are of questionable quality and limited in the languages they support
- Ordinary translation tools only support web page translation, but we also have a large number of e-books, PDF, TXT, subtitle files and other documents need to be translated!

So many people only use translation tools to view information when it's most necessary, and I used the translation that came with my system for quite a while -- until after I read a bilingual copy of Little Women.

I just realized how important the bilingual reading experience is:

- I can read the original message.
- I can also quickly look at the translation and when I read something that doesn't make sense, I immediately check the original text
- Learn English while you read!
- Stop being afraid of foreign language works and develop the habit of reading foreign language works

So Immersive Translate [was born](https://twitter.com/OwenYoungZh/status/1588792579596111872), and I didn't expect that as soon as it was released, countless people with the same needs as mine started to use Immersive Translate to read huge amounts of foreign language information with high frequency:

[![Star History Chart](https://api.star-history.com/svg?repos=immersive-translate/immersive-translate\&type=Date)](https://star-history .com/#immersive-translate/immersive-translate\&Date)

Then we step by step to optimize for various reading needs, including support for real-time translation of PDF files, support for real-time translation and production of Epub e-books, support for subtitle files, TXT files and so on and so forth.

Times are tough, and we know that not everyone can afford to pay for more and more tools and content, so we're making this tool available for free to all who need it, and we firmly believe that equal access to information is the most deserved right we all have. -->
