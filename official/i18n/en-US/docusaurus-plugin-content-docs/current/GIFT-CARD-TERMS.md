# Immersive Translate Gift Card and Redemption Code Terms

Last updated: February 2, 2026

These Immersive Translate Gift Card and Redemption Code Terms (the "Terms") apply to the purchase, use, and redemption of all Immersive Translate gift cards and redemption codes. These Terms supplement the Immersive Translate Terms of Service and Privacy Policy and apply together with them. Any terms used but not defined in these Terms have the meanings defined in the Terms of Service or Privacy Policy. By purchasing, accepting, or redeeming a gift card or redemption code, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms.

If you have any questions about gift cards, redemption codes, or these Terms, please contact us.

## 1. Gift Cards and Redemption Codes; Applicable Subscriptions

Immersive Translate gift cards and redemption codes are prepaid subscription benefits used to redeem Immersive Translate Pro or Max subscription plans. The subscription term is fixed (currently 1 year, unless otherwise specified on the gift card or redemption code).

Gift cards and redemption codes:

- are only for Immersive Translate subscription services
- do not apply to other products or services
- cannot be reloaded or have additional value added after purchase or issuance
- are not redeemable for cash or any other form of balance

## 2. Purchase and Delivery

Gift cards can be purchased through the official Immersive Translate website.

After purchase:

- Gift cards will appear under Gift Cards / Your Gift Cards in the purchaser's account
- The system will generate a unique redemption code for each gift card based on the recipient information
  - If a recipient email is provided at purchase, the system can send a gift card email containing the redemption code
  - We collect the recipient email only for sending the gift card email and for no other purpose

If the purchaser changes the recipient information:

- The system will regenerate a new redemption code
- The original redemption code will become invalid and cannot be used

The purchaser is responsible for safeguarding redemption codes and ensuring only valid codes are provided to the recipient.

## 3. Redemption

To redeem a gift card or redemption code, the recipient must:

1. Open the gift card redemption link or enter the redemption code
2. Log in or register for an Immersive Translate account
3. Confirm redemption

After redemption:

- The corresponding Pro or Max subscription benefits take effect immediately
- No payment method is required at redemption
- Auto-renewal is not enabled by default

Gift cards and redemption codes can be redeemed by new users or by users with existing accounts.

## 4. Existing Subscribers

If the recipient already has an active Immersive Translate subscription:

- The gift card or redemption code term will be added after the current subscription period ends
- The existing subscription will continue to function normally

## 5. Validity Period

Gift cards and redemption codes are valid for 12 months from the date of purchase or issuance (unless otherwise stated) and must be redeemed within the validity period.

If a gift card or redemption code is not redeemed within the validity period:

- The gift card or redemption code will become invalid
- It cannot be used
- No refunds or re-issuance are supported

Immersive Translate may send reminder emails before gift cards expire, but assumes no responsibility for expiration due to failure to redeem in time.

## 6. Transfers

Before a gift card is redeemed:

- The purchaser may transfer the gift card to another person by sharing the redemption link

Once a gift card or redemption code is redeemed:

- The subscription benefits cannot be transferred to another account or person

Only the purchaser can view and manage gift card information in their account.

## 7. No Refunds, No Cash Redemption, and No Resale

Except as required by law:

- Gift cards and redemption codes are non-refundable once purchased or issued
- They cannot be redeemed for cash
- They may not be resold, exchanged, or used for any form of commercial resale

If a gift card or redemption code is obtained through unauthorized resale, scalping, or other violations, Immersive Translate may void it at its sole discretion.

## 8. Risk Notice

Please keep the gift card redemption link and redemption code secure.

Immersive Translate is not responsible for:

- Lost or stolen gift card redemption links or redemption codes
- Unauthorized redemption caused by others using the link or code

## 9. Use Restrictions

Without prior written permission from Immersive Translate, gift cards and redemption codes may not be used for:

- Advertising, marketing, or promotional activities
- Any use that implies a partnership, endorsement, or sponsorship relationship with a third party

If fraud, abuse, or violations of these Terms are found, Immersive Translate may suspend or terminate the use of related gift cards, redemption codes, or accounts.

## 10. Upgrades and Renewals

After redeeming a gift card or redemption code:

- Users may choose to upgrade in their account to a monthly subscription, annual subscription, or other paid plans
- Any upgrade is entirely at the user's discretion and is unrelated to the use of gift cards or redemption codes

## 11. Changes to These Terms

Immersive Translate reserves the right to modify or update these Terms at any time.
The latest version will be published on the official website and will supersede all prior versions.
