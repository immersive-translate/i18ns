# Stripe Customer Invoice Balance Introduction

## What is Customer Invoice Balance?

When you adjust your subscription, cancel certain services, or have excess amounts (non-refund operations), the excess portion will be immediately deposited into your Customer Invoice Balance.
It is equivalent to your balance on the Stripe platform and can be used to offset future consumption.

## Why does Customer Invoice Balance occur?

You downgrade your subscription, and the new plan has lower fees → The difference will be refunded to your Customer Invoice Balance.

You cancel a plan early → The unused fees calculated proportionally will automatically be refunded to your Customer Invoice Balance.

You previously overpaid → The overpaid amount will be deposited into your Customer Invoice Balance.

## How is Customer Invoice Balance used?

During the next billing cycle (e.g., monthly renewal), the system will prioritize using the Customer Invoice Balance for deduction.

If the Customer Invoice Balance is sufficient, no additional payment is required.

If the Customer Invoice Balance is insufficient, you only need to pay the difference.

## Does Customer Invoice Balance expire?

No. The Customer Invoice Balance will remain in your account until it is fully used.

## How to view Customer Invoice Balance?

In Personal Center → Manage Subscription → View Details of Next Payment, you can view the application's Customer Invoice Balance.
